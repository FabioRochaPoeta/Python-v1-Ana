#Questão 01

#Desenvolva uma função que calcule a divisão de uma conta de consumo (conta de restaurante ou bar), 
#em reais, considerando o número de pessoas que estavam consumindo e a taxa de serviço que será paga ao garçom.
#Ao usuário do programa serão solicitados o valor total do consumo, em reais, o número total de pessoas
# e o percentual do serviço prestado, entre 0 e 100.
